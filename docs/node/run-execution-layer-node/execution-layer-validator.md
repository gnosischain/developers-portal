# Run a Gnosis Chain Execution Layer Node

You can also run a Gnosis Chain Execution Layer Node on the same machine as your Beacon Chain node(s). This is reccomeneded for more experienced node runners, but is highly encouraged as it increases decentralization of the network. If you don't wish to do this, you can just ignore this section and connect your node through an existing JSON RPC endpoint. Using an existing RPC is the easiest method when you first setup your node. It is also encouraged to use an existing RPC during setup as it can take a while (up to 3 days, depeneding on your setup) for your execution layer node to fully sync. You will be encouraged to update your setup once the merge happens. If you have experience and want to setup your own GC node now, read on!

## Technical Requirements

GC Nodes can be run with Nethermind client and the following recommended minimum specs:

* OS: Ubuntu, Windows & MacOs
* CPU: 2 cores
* RAM: 4GB
* Disk: 100gb SSD
* Git installed `git --version`

## Setup on Nethermind

:::caution
A majority of Gnosis Chain validators are now running the Nethermind client. The latest version 1.12.7 includes support for the latest Gnosis Chain HF.

Version [https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.12.7](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.12.7)

:::

Nethermind Launcher is a self-contained app - you do not need to install .NET separately to run it.

* [Platform-specific instructions for running the client](https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/ethereum-client/running-nethermind/running-the-client)
* The Nethermind Launcher will present several options on start. Use arrow keys to select options[ Available CLI methods ](https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/nethermind-utilities/cli)- CLI supports javascript.
* [Understanding logs](https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/first-steps-with-nethermind/getting-started#explaining-nethermind-logs)

:::note
When you start the Launcher choose the following options to sync a node:

* Start Nethermind: **Node**
* Select network: **xDai**
* Select sync: **Fast sync**

### Setup Instructions (Linux)

#### 1) Set up directories and docker-compose.yml file

*Replace `<user>` with your username on your device*
```
    cd 
    mkdir /home/<user>/nethermind
    mkdir /home/<user>/nethermind/nethermind_db
    mkdir /home/<user>/nethermind/keystore
    mkdir /home/<user>/nethermind/logs
```
Create docker-compose.yml:
```
nano /home/<user>/nethermind/docker-compose.yml
```
Add the following text:
```
version: "3.7"
services:

  nethermind:
    hostname: nethermind
    container_name: nethermind
    image: nethermind/nethermind:latest
    restart: always
    stop_grace_period: 1m
    networks:
      net:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.32.100
    ports:
      - "30303:30303/tcp"
      - "30303:30303/udp"
    volumes:
      - /home/<user>/nethermind/nethermind_db:/nethermind/nethermind_db
      - /home/<user>/nethermind/keystore:/nethermind/keystore
      - /home/<user>/nethermind/logs:/nethermind/logs
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    environment:
      - NETHERMIND_CONFIG=xdai
    logging:
      driver: "local"
 
networks:
  net:
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: "192.168.32.0/24"
```
:::note
Be mindful of spacing, yaml is very particular and the error messages for malformed yaml aren't always intuitive. Also, for those unfamiliar with nano, `Ctl-o` to save and `Ctl-x` to close :)
:::

#### 2) Start Nethermind

```
cd nethermind
docker-compose up
```
To check logs:
```
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker-compose logs -f <container name> 
```
Container name should in this case be 'nethermind'

:::note
This can take 1-3 days to sync, so in the meantime you can connect your Beacon chain node to a public RPC
:::


### **Sharing machines for GC and GBC clients**

As was mentioned on the doc page for running a beacon chain node, if you decide to run a Gnosis Chain client (Nethermind) and a Gnosis Beacon Chain client (Lighthouse or Prysm) on the same machine, we recommend [running both in the same docker-compose.yml ](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/)file to enable RPC access by container name.
