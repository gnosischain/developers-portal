# Using the xDai Bridge

### Basic operations

Instructions for usage with the UI are available:

* [Moving Dai to xDai](/bridges/xdai/moving-dai-to-xdai)
* [Moving xDai to Dai](/bridges/xdai/moving-xdai-to-dai)

The bridge can also be used [without the UI](/specs/bridges/xdai/use/without-ui).

### Advanced operations

It is possible to move Dai to xDai and back to an alternative receiver by calling the bridge methods directly as in [this manual](/specs/bridges/xdai/use/alternative-receiver).
