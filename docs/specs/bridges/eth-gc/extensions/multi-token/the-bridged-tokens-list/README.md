The OmniBridge multi-token bridge extension is now being used to bridge many tokens from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain. A second instance bridges tokens to and from the Binance Smart Chain. When a token is bridged, the name is appended with _**on GC**_. On a token page, you can also find the link to the original token on Ethereum. For more, see the [corresponding token contract addresses page](/specs/bridges/eth-gc/extensions/multi-token/correspondence-of-bridgeable-tokens).
