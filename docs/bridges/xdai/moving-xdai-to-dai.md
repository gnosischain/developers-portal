# Moving xDai to Dai

{@youtube: oKdh2cOOqUs,start=105}

:::info
We recommend using Chrome + Metamask + No Ad Blockers to complete the process.

You will need a **small additional amount of xDai** to process the first transaction, and an **additional amount of Eth** to process the claim transaction on Ethereum.
:::

1\) Go to [https://bridge.gnosischain.com/](https://bridge.gnosischain.com/). [Connect your web3 wallet](../../wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) (MetaMask, Nifty Wallet) to the **Gnosis Chain**. Once connected, you will see your address populated in the header, and your xDai and Dai balance displayed on the page.

_Note: If you change the dropdown on the page (Gnosis Chain) but not in MetaMask, the interface will shift but your wallet will not auto-connect to the chain. Switching chains in MM will automatically shift the interface._

2\) Enter the amount of xDai you would like to transfer to Dai, and click the **Request** button. Note the **minimum amount is 10 xDai.**

3\) Confirm that you will need to perform 2 transactions, and will need xDai and Eth to complete the transfer.

8\) **Confirm** the second claim transaction in MetaMask (you will need some Eth for gas fees). Once processed, the Dai should be available in your wallet.
